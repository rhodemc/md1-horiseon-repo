## Description

I was motivated to refactor code for Horiseon because I feel their site has useful information for those who are interested in online marketing.

Having a singular site for online marketing info allows for ease of use and quick reference. It's a great starting point for those who want to learn more.

When using the refactored site, links now function properly, text is easier to read and alt tags for images can be found. A deeper dive into code will show updated semantics and a condensed, logical CSS stylesheet.

## Installation

## Usage

To enjoy this site, use the links at the top right of the page to choose which topic you'd like to learn about. Each section will provide basic knowledge on the subject matter.
